# Hand Gesture Identification

This project is a Python application for real-time hand gesture identification using the MediaPipe Hands library for hand landmark detection and OpenCV for video capture and processing. It can detect hand gestures in a live video stream from a webcam and count the number of fingers extended in each detected hand.

## Introduction

Hand gesture identification has various applications, including sign language recognition, gesture-based control systems, and virtual reality interactions. This project provides a simple yet effective solution for real-time hand gesture identification using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe Hands library
- Counts the number of fingers extended in each hand gesture
- Displays the finger count on the video feed in real-time
- Supports various hand gestures, including open hand, fist, and different finger configurations

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2100031988/hand_gesture_identification.git
2. download the needed files

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. run the final code
   
   python main.py

## Usage

Once the script is running, it will open a window displaying the live video feed from your webcam. It will detect hand gestures and count the number of fingers extended in each hand.

- Extend your hand in front of the camera to see the detected hand landmarks and finger count.
- Try different hand gestures, such as open hand, fist, and various finger configurations, to observe the detection accuracy.
