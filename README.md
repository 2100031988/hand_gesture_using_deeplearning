# Hand Gesture Identification

This project is a Python application for real-time hand gesture identification using the MediaPipe Hands library for hand landmark detection and OpenCV for video capture and processing. It can detect hand gestures in a live video stream from a webcam and count the number of fingers extended in each detected hand.

## Introduction

Hand gesture identification has various applications, including sign language recognition, gesture-based control systems, and virtual reality interactions. This project provides a simple yet effective solution for real-time hand gesture identification using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe Hands library
- Counts the number of fingers extended in each hand gesture
- Displays the finger count on the video feed in real-time
- Supports various hand gestures, including open hand, fist, and different finger configurations
